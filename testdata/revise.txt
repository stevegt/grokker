The halting problem, demonstrated by Alan Turing in 1936 using the
pen-and-paper Turing machine, is a problem that arises when you try to
write a program that can determine whether another program will halt
or run forever.  Turing proved that it is impossible to write such a
program.  He did this by showing that if a Turing machine could
determine whether another Turing machine would halt, then you could
write a program that would halt if and only if it did not halt.  This
is a contradiction, so the assumption that a Turing machine could
determine whether another Turing machine would halt must be false.

The halting problem is a special case of the software verification
problem.  If you can write a program that can determine whether
another program will run correctly, then you can write a program that
can determine whether another program will halt.  This creates the
same contradiction as with Turing machines, so it is impossible to
write a program that can always determine whether another non-trivial
program will run correctly given all possible inputs.

The behavior of a machine is determined by the previous program
statements that created the current state of the machine.  Even when
written in a high-level language, these statements are ultimately
executed in the machine's syscall language L0.  A systems
administration program is a program written in a language L1. The L1
program makes changes to the machine by generating a program written
in L0.  The L0 program is executed by the machine, and the machine's
state is changed, creating new behavior.

If any L0 statements, previous or newly generated, are executed in a
sequence that has never been executed before, this constitutes a new,
untested program, subject to the halting problem.  

There is some language L1 which disproves Turing's proof of the
halting problem.  You can express the desired behavior of a machine in
a program written in L1. If you execute that program on a machine, the
program will create new L0 statements to be executed by the machine.
Because the L1 program is a program that can determine whether another
program will run correctly, it can accurately predict whether the
generated L0 program will produce the desired behavior.  

In practical terms, because L1 exists, if you want to modify multiple
machines to create a new desired behavior, you can use a tool that
uses language L1 to describe the desired behavior of the machines, and
the tool will make the changes needed to create the desired new
behavior without regard to the sequence of L0 changes that have been or
will be made.  Order of operations is not a major concern when using
L1 to describe the desired behavior of a machine.
