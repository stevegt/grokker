Plan perplexity API inclusion

Plan to add perplexity.ai's API and models to grokker.  Users
should be able to select perplexity models as well as openai models.
They should not need to select the provider, just the model name; in
other words, there should be no provider flag or subcommand.  

- The Provider name should be a field in the Model struct for use by
  the request handler.  
- Remove the ActiveProvider field from the Grokker struct.  
- In NewModels, keep all existing models.  Add the provider name to
  the Provider field of the Model struct.
- Perplexity uses the same chat completion API as OpenAI.  The
  completion function should be the same for both providers.  The only
  difference is the endpoint URL and the model name.  

At the end of plan.md, list the files that will be changed by this
plan.  The files should be listed one per line, with the full path
from the root of the repository, and no leading or trailing whitespace
or formatting.
