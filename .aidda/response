Below are several recommendations to improve the code quality, maintainability, and overall consistency:

1. Error handling and logging  
 • The code relies on helper functions like Ck(err) and Return(&err) throughout. Although they reduce boilerplate, it can be beneficial to use standard error wrapping (for example, using fmt.Errorf or errors.Wrap) and a proper logging library instead of printing directly with Pf/Pl. This makes debugging easier and lets you add additional context when an error occurs.  
 • In some places (for example, in readPrompt or migration code), errors are simply printed or asserted. Consider refactoring these to use well‐defined error values that can be returned and (if needed) wrapped with more context.

2. Separation of concerns and modularity  
 • Some functions (for example, getPrompt) both read a file, parse headers, convert relative paths to absolute using a parent directory, and also open an editor if a certain environment variable is defined. Breaking these responsibilities into smaller helper functions will make the code easier to test and maintain.  
 • The parsing of prompt files (and headers) is currently mixed with user interaction. Splitting the logic — one part for file I/O and header extraction and another for user prompting — can lead to clearer code.

3. Code organization and migration handling  
 • The migration logic in migrateOneVersion (and its switch on version strings) works but can be improved by using a table‐driven approach. Defining a list (or map) of migration functions keyed by version range would make the code easier to extend in the future and might eliminate some duplication.  
 • Similarly, many subcommands in the CLI package use large switch statements. Consider moving each command into its own command object or method so that the main switch becomes a thin dispatcher. This may also help when migrating to frameworks like kong completely.

4. Consistent formatting and naming  
 • Some functions have comments that refer to outdated variable names (for instance, references to “TXT” versus “text” or commented-out code in splitChunk). Such comments should be reviewed and updated so they accurately describe the functionality.  
 • Naming can be clarified in a few places: for example, for helper functions that take a filename (promptFn, ignoreFn, etc.), consider grouping these under a configuration struct. That way, changing file paths becomes easier and the use sites are more self-documenting.

5. Improved testing and skipping  
 • Several tests (for instance, TestSplitFile in split_test.go) are marked with t.Skip; if these pieces are meant to be run later, consider adding a comment about why they are skipped or moving them to an integration test package.  
 • Consider using table-driven tests in areas where similar functionality is being tested with multiple inputs (for example, in testing the header extraction or token counting).

6. Parsing and regular expressions  
 • The code uses regular expressions to parse file chunks and to extract headers from prompt files. If the format becomes more complex (or if more languages are added), consider using a proper parsing library (or a structured format such as JSON or YAML) for configuration or prompt files.  
 • In functions like OutfilesRegex, consider building the regex in a more data‐driven way to ease maintenance if the file header/footer format ever needs to change.

7. Dependency management and abstraction over external APIs  
 • The code already supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Perplexity) by dispatching via a gateway. In that spirit, you might further formalize the providers by having all client implementations (for chat and embeddings) satisfy an interface and letting dependency injection decide which to use.  
 • For tokenization, the code uses a global Tokenizer variable from tiktoken-go. Consider wrapping this in a separate package so that any future changes (for example, using a different tokenizer) are easier to accommodate.

8. Code documentation and clarity  
 • While many functions are commented, a few functions (for example in the core package) are quite long. Reviewing them for readability—by splitting into smaller functions where logical boundaries exist—will help future maintainers.  
 • Add usage examples or clearer doc comments to exported functions so that users of the library (or new developers on the project) can understand the intent and expected behavior more rapidly.

By addressing these points—refactoring some monolithic functions, establishing clearer boundaries between I/O and processing, using table-driven approaches for similar logic (like migrations), and adopting modern error and logging practices—you will improve both the maintainability and reliability of the codebase.
