Below is a discussion of one proposed approach (using XML‐style delimiters) along with some alternatives, along with an outline of which files you might need to change.

────────────────────────────
Proposed XML file delimiters

One idea is to mark the start and end of each file with unique XML tags. For example, for each file you could have something like:
  
  <File name="net.go" language="go">
   … file text …
  </File>

This format is very structured and, if included verbatim in your system prompt or response, leaves little room for ambiguity. The LLM is more likely to leave the XML tags intact (as long as you explain that they are required delimiters). You could adjust your system prompt to say “Return your output embedded in XML tags exactly like …” so that the LLM returns the file codes without extra text.

Pros:
 • Clearly defined boundaries using open/close tags.
 • Can embed attributes (like file name and language) in a standard way.
 • Many XML parsers exist if you eventually need to post‑process the output.

Cons:
 • XML syntax is somewhat verbose.
 • Some LLM completions may reformat or “explain” the XML rather than returning a raw XML block unless explicitly instructed.
 • If your users (or test code) are accustomed to the current regex‐based extraction from code fences, you will need to change not only the system prompt but also the extraction logic.

Alternative delimiters

1. JSON objects

You could have the LLM return a JSON object where each file is described as an element in an array. For example:
  
  {
   "files": [
    {"name": "net.go", "language": "go", "content": "… file text …"},
    …
   ]
  }

Pros:
 • JSON is ubiquitous and many languages (including Go) have good JSON decoders.
 • The structure is clear.
 • The output is very likely to be valid JSON if you provide clear instructions.

Cons:
 • LLMs sometimes “explain” JSON rather than return a pure JSON object.
 • It may be a bit too much if you only have one file in many cases.
 • The formatting might be inconsistent if the number of files is variable.

2. Markdown-style Code Fences with Clear Headers

You could keep using markdown code fences but add an explicit file header. For example:

  File: net.go  
  ```go
  … file text …
  ```  
  EOF_net.go

Pros:
 • This is already close to your current approach.
 • It leverages a common markdown convention.
 • Many LLMs are already trained on code fences so they may follow them quite naturally.

Cons:
 • Ambiguity sometimes remains if the LLM “edits” the fence formatting.
 • If your extraction regex is not robust or if the instructions are not absolute, slight deviations in punctuation might cause matching failures.

3. Custom non‑XML delimiters (for example, unique tokens)

For instance, you could define a “start marker” and “stop marker” that are unlikely to occur naturally (e.g. “<<<START-FILE:net.go:go>>>” and “<<<END-FILE:net.go>>>”). A clear instruction in your system prompt is critical.

Pros:
 • Unique tokens lower the chance of misinterpretation.
 • They can be as terse as you want.

Cons:
 • They are “ad hoc” and nobody in the ecosystem uses them (so you’re reinventing the wheel).
 • You must update your extraction logic to search for these custom markers.

────────────────────────────
Discussion of Files to Change

In your Grokker codebase the delimiters are currently defined and used by regular expressions. To switch from regexes based on code fences to XML file delimiters, you would need to modify code in (at least) the following areas:

1. In core/chat.go:
 • The function OutfilesRegex – currently it builds a regex that looks for “File:” headers plus code fences with backticks. You would change this so that it builds a regex expecting something like:
   <File name="…" language="…">((?s:.*?))</File>
 • Similarly, in ExtractFiles you would update the regex used to find the file blocks in the LLM output so that it now matches XML tags.

2. In cli/cli.go:
 • In the “chat” subcommand block, there is a portion that checks if cli.Chat.OutputFilesRegex is true and then calls regexp.MustCompile(core.OutfilesRegex(nil)). This logic would need to be updated so that it expects XML delimiters rather than the current format.

3. In any unit tests:
 • The tests in cli/cli_test.go (and possibly in migration_test.go etc.) that look for expected output in the extracted files or that compare against a regex will need to be updated to accommodate the new XML delimiters rather than the previous pattern.

4. In any system prompt instructions:
 • The prompts given to the LLM (including in system messages in cli/cli.go and in the OpenAI chat client in openai/openai.go) must be updated from “return files enclosed in your current regex format” to “return each file as an XML element such as …”. Make sure that the instructions do not get “edited away” by the LLM too.

5. Possibly in the aidda package:
 • If aidda extracts code snippets from chat responses, then those functions must be updated as well.

────────────────────────────
Summary

Using XML file delimiters has the advantage of being highly structured and explicit. Alternatives such as JSON output or custom unique tokens (or even refined code fence formats) might also work. The tradeoffs come down to the likelihood that the LLM will adhere strictly to a given format versus the ease of implementing a robust parser on the Go side.

If you decide to refactor to XML delimiters, you would primarily modify functions that create and parse the file boundaries (for example, OutfilesRegex and ExtractFiles in the core/chat.go file), the cli subcommand handling (cli/cli.go), and update your unit tests in cli/cli_test.go (and others) so that they accept the new XML format.

Each alternative requires a similar update in the parsing/extraction routines and changes to the LLM prompt instructions. Choose the one that best balances structure with ease-of-implementation and that your LLM best “learns” to follow.

That is the high‑level evaluation and proposed changes for this refactor.
