Below is a list of the files that currently contain the regex‐based I/O logic (or tests that expect it) and that would need to be modified when switching to structured file I/O via the OpenAI and Perplexity APIs:

• /home/stevegt/lab/grokker/v3/llm-file-io/discussion.md  
  – Contains the documentation and discussion of the proposed new file delimiters/structured I/O.

• /home/stevegt/lab/grokker/v3/cli/cli.go  
  – In the “chat” subcommand, the code builds and applies a regular expression (via core.OutfilesRegex) to extract output files from LLM responses. This logic will need to be changed to use structured output.

• / home/stevegt/lab/grokker/v3/core/chat.go  
  – This file defines functions such as OutfilesRegex and ExtractFiles that perform regex-based extraction of file blocks. These functions will have to be refactored to handle structured I/O instead.

• / home/stevegt/lab/grokker/v3/cli/cli_test.go  
  – Some unit tests are verifying the behavior of file extraction (using the expected regex patterns). These tests will need to be updated once the extraction mechanism becomes structured.

These four files are the primary candidates for modifications; additional adjustments may be needed in areas where LLM prompt instructions are set (for example in cli/cli.go and openai/openai.go) so that the LLM is instructed to return the new structured format instead of plain text with code fences.
