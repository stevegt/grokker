The PromiseGrid system architecture presents a comprehensive design for a distributed computing framework based on security capability tokens and a hypergraph transaction model. The design aligns closely with the specified requirements, including the representation of tokens as cryptographically secured promises that create creditor-debtor relationships, kernel-mediated token issuance via Mach-like receive ports, and the use of a directed acyclic hypergraph to model transactions and system states. The architecture supports speculative execution by allowing parallel transaction paths and incorporates a token-based economy with atomic swaps and reputation incentives.

A key discrepancy lies in the hypergraph's hashing scheme: while the design specifies that hyperedges include hashes of predecessor nodes, it does not explicitly state that nodes include hashes of the hyperedges that created them. This omission could weaken the bidirectional integrity of the chain of custody within the hypergraph. Additionally, the design's reference to CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) is conceptual rather than detailed, lacking concrete implementation specifics that could affect interoperability.

Other areas such as token redemption workflows, economic incentive mechanisms, and kernel port management are well covered but could benefit from further elaboration on failure modes, reputation quantification, and scalability considerations. The design also raises open research questions around conflict resolution, reputation systems, garbage collection, cross-chain integration, and formal verification.

Overall, the PromiseGrid design robustly meets most core requirements but should address the noted hashing ambiguity and deepen implementation details to ensure security, consistency, and practical operability in a decentralized environment.
