# bugs

- DONE inconsistent display of prompts and responses (not all users see both)
  - was due to read timeout setting -- replaced with ping/pong keepalive
- need spinner in status box
- need to stop removing '[\d+]' indexes from array variables

# features

- really need https://playwright.dev/ to test
- refactor to be able to one daemon on one port number for multiple projects
- logins so we can support co-authored-by headers in git commits
- "jump to end" button
