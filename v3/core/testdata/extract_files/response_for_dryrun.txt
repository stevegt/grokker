I'll create two files for dry-run testing:

---FILE-START filename="file1.txt"---
First file content for dry-run test.
This should be detected without being written to disk.
The extraction process should verify the structure.
---FILE-END filename="file1.txt"---

---FILE-START filename="file2.txt"---
Second file content for dry-run test.
Both files should be processed and reported.
No actual files should be created when DryRun is true.
---FILE-END filename="file2.txt"---

This completes the dry-run test scenario.
