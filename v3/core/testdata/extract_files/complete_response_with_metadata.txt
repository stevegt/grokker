<think>
I need to create a comprehensive response with all metadata sections.
This includes thinking, the file, references, and reasoning.
The user should see all parts processed correctly.
</think>

Based on the request, I've created the following file:

---FILE-START filename="result.txt"---
Complete Solution File

This file demonstrates a comprehensive response structure.
It contains properly formatted content.
All metadata sections are handled appropriately.
The file extraction process should work correctly.
---FILE-END filename="result.txt"---

## References

- [1] [https://example.com/reference1](https://example.com/reference1)
- [2] [https://example.com/reference2](https://example.com/reference2)

## Reasoning

The solution was derived through careful analysis of the requirements:
- Understanding the expected output format
- Creating properly structured file blocks
- Ensuring all metadata is correctly positioned
- Validating the extraction process

This comprehensive example demonstrates proper handling of complex responses.
