<think>
This is the thinking process where I work through the problem step by step.
I'll analyze what files need to be created.
The user wants an output file.
I should create a complete, well-formed file.
</think>

Now I'll create the output file:

---FILE-START filename="output.txt"---
This is the output after thinking.
The thinking section should have been removed.
Only this content remains in the cooked response.
---FILE-END filename="output.txt"---

The thinking process is complete.
