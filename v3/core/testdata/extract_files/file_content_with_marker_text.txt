I'll create a README that documents file markers:

---FILE-START filename="readme.md"---
# File Extraction Format

This document explains the file marker format used in responses.

## Marker Format

Files are marked with the following format:

---FILE-START filename="filename"---
[file content goes here]
---FILE-END filename="filename"---

Note that the start marker is:
`---FILE-START filename="<name>"---`

And the end marker is:
`---FILE-END filename="<name>"---`

These markers are used to delimit file content in responses.

## Implementation

When parsing responses, look for lines that match:
- Start: `---FILE-START filename="..."`
- End: `---FILE-END filename="..."`

Content between these markers should be extracted exactly as-is.
---FILE-END filename="readme.md"---

This file contains documentation about the marker format itself.
