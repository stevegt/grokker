I'll demonstrate nested file blocks:

---FILE-START filename="outer.txt"---
This is the outer file content.

---FILE-START filename="inner.txt"---
This is the inner file content.
It's nested inside the outer file block.
Multiple lines of inner content.
---FILE-END filename="inner.txt"---

Back to outer file content after inner file.
More outer file content here.
---FILE-END filename="outer.txt"---

Both files should be properly extracted despite nesting.
