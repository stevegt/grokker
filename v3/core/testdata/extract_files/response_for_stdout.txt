I'll create a file suitable for stdout output:

---FILE-START filename="stdout.txt"---
Output for standard output stream.

This content should be displayed on stdout
when the ExtractToStdout option is enabled.

Multiple lines are included to test
the stdout extraction functionality.
---FILE-END filename="stdout.txt"---

The file is ready for standard output redirection.
