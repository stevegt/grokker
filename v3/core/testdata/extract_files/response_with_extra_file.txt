I'll create the expected file:

---FILE-START filename="expected.txt"---
This is the expected file content.
---FILE-END filename="expected.txt"---

I also created an unexpected file for reference:

---FILE-START filename="unexpected_output.txt"---
This file was not requested but is included for informational purposes.
---FILE-END filename="unexpected_output.txt"---

Both files are complete.
