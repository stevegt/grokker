I'll create a complex response with multiple file scenarios:

---FILE-START filename="expected1.txt"---
First expected file content.
This file should be marked as extracted.
---FILE-END filename="expected1.txt"---

Some discussion text here.

---FILE-START filename="unexpected1.txt"---
This file was not requested but is included in the response.
It should be tracked as an unexpected file.
---FILE-END filename="unexpected1.txt"---

More discussion content.

---FILE-START filename="broken.txt"---
This file starts but never ends properly.
The response ends while still inside this file block.
